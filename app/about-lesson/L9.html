		<h2>SKILL SUMMARY</h2>
		<h3>IN THIS LESSON YOU LEARNED:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>  HTML and CSS have a number of facilities for fast animation of common effects. However, JavaScript is far more flexible and can produce remarkable results. </li>
			<li>   JavaScript is a powerful general-purpose programming language. If you can imagine a particular animation, there’s probably a way to create it in JavaScript.</li>
			<li>   You can use JavaScript to display an image when a button is clicked or some other event occurs. The createElement method works well for this use.</li>
			<li>  If an application accessible from your computer exposes data to you as an end user, there’s probably a way for JavaScript to reach the data. One of the most important roles of JavaScript is to communicate in real-time with remote data sources.</li>
			<li>   As a general-purpose language, JavaScript can communicate structured information much richer than the simple values used in most of this lesson.</li>
			<li>  JavaScript can access files on your local computer and, with HTML5, can validate the file type before loading. JavaScript makes loading files a more interactive and error-free process.</li>
			<li>   Users want to be able to browse your site even when offline. The Application Cache (AppCache) API makes this possible. AppCache differs from browser cache in that browser cache contains all Web pages visited, whereas AppCache saves only the files listed in the cache manifest.</li>
			<li>  In JavaScript, data comes in a few different flavors. The most common are strings and numbers. Other data types include array, Boolean, null, object, and undefined.</li>
			<li>   As end users enter data in a form, JavaScript can instantly validate entries and suggest alternatives.</li>
			<li>   Cookies have traditionally held information that allows for personalization, customization, and convenience. JavaScript can create and retrieve cookies.</li>
			<li>   Cookies are limited in the information they store, and therefore in the effects program-ming with them can achieve. Plus, cookies pose a threat to data privacy. HTML5 provides local storage to make personalization easier to program and more capable.</li>
