		<h2>SKILL SUMMARY</h2>
		<h3>IN THIS LESSON YOU LEARNED:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) uses markup to describe content for display on a Web page.</li>
			<li>An element is the combination of tags and the content they enclose. You may need to use special characters on a Web page, which requires character encoding.</li>
			<li>Every Web page requires the doctype declaration at the top of the page.</li>
			<li>HTML5 uses most of the same elements and attributes specified in HTML 4, and has introduced some new tags, modified the preferred usage of others, and no longer supports certain elements. New text-related elements include command, mark, time, meter, and progress. A few of the deprecated elements are basefont, center, font, and strike.</li>
			<li>Use the img element to display linked images in a Web page. The images can be located with the Web pages HTML files, usually in an images subfolder, or on a different server or Web site.</li>
			<li>The figure and figure caption elements are new to HTML5 and give you more control or the type of image you are displaying and the ability to include captions.</li>
			<li>The canvas element is used for drawing, rendering, and manipulating images and graphics dynamically in HTML5.</li>
			<li>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) enables you to create scalable objects that resize to best fit the screen on which theyâ€™re viewed, whether a PC screen or a smartphone.</li>
			<li>HTML5 introduces the audio and video elements, which do away with the need for plug-ins or media players to listen to music or watch videos via a Web browser.</li>
