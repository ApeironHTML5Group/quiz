        IN THIS  LESSON YOU LEARNED:
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5 is the latest HTML standard and a family of technologies that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although  the HTML5 standard won’t  be finalized for a few years, most modern Web browsers already support HTML5 elements, and HTML5 app development for Web and mobile device browsers is well underway.</li>
			<li>The HTML5 family includes many new markup tags and technologies like media queries, geolocation, Modernizr, and much more.</li>
			<li>The general steps for creating an app are: plan the project, design a UI, update the app mani- fest, write code, build the app, debug and test the app, package the app, and deploy the app.</li>
			<li>The Windows  Runtime (WinRT) environment  is the foundation  of the Windows 8 operating system and provides functionality  to Metro style apps.</li>
			<li>Metro style apps created with JavaScript and that are opened in Internet Explorer are run by the WWAHost.exe  process. This is a different  process than the host process that  ordi- narily runs Internet Explorer.</li>
            <li>The purpose of an app package is for ease of distribution and deployment. Application packaging bundles an app’s files and folders into an app package.</li>
			<li>The .NET Framework provides a secure environment in which HTML5/JavaScript apps can run. The framework  uses security transparency to separate different kinds of code while running, and uses permission sets and identity  permissions to control the environment.</li>
			<li>A session state is created when a user first requests access to an application, and it ends when the session closes.</li>
			<li>An application state exists from the time a Web browser requests a Web page until the browser closes.</li>
			<li>Persist state information  is data that exists after a session ends.</li>
			<li>In HTML5, developers can use the localStorage and sessionStorage JavaScript methods to deal efficiently with state data.</li>
			<li>AppCache is a type of Web storage that enables a user to load data that’s ordinarily stored on a server even when the user is offline.</li>
			<li>On a touch-screen device, a finger move is called a gesture, and the response by the app to that gesture is called an event.</li>
			<li>Developing touch-enabled apps requires thorough knowledge of how fingers interact with the screen and planning for different  sizes of fingers.</li>
			<li>You can use JavaScript to create touch-enabled apps, primarily using the touchstart,touchend, and touchmove events.</li>
			<li>An advantage for seasoned developers who want to create Metro style apps is that their existing HTML5 skills and code lend themselves well to Metro app development.</li>
			<li>All apps must be thoroughly tested and debugged to ensure they run reliably and as error- free as possible before distribution  and deployment.</li>
			<li>Once your app has been tested, debugged, and the code validated or certified, you need to take a few more steps to prepare it for upload to a marketplace  such as the Windows Store. You can use Visual Studio 11 or Visual Studio 11 Express to complete the project.</li>
