		<h2>SKILL SUMMARY</h2>
		<h3>IN THIS LESSON YOU LEARNED:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>  HTML5 and CSS3 make a great foundation for your Web site or mobile application. To do anything more than presentation of structured content, though—to respond with indi-vidualized data about a specific end user, or transact on-line commerce, or derive results based on data already entered, for instance—takes real programming. JavaScript is a capable programming language with great abilities to express the interactions you want your end users to have with your app.</li>
			<li>  A function is a segment of a program defined and performed in isolation from other parts. The action of a function is the sequence of the actions of the statements inside of it. </li>
			<li>  The most effective programmers know how to make good use of what others write. A pro-gramming library contains snippets of code, subroutines, classes, and other resources you can re-use to create software. There are many JavaScript libraries available, and jQuery is one of the most popular</li>
			<li>  JavaScript is essential for nearly all the effects of modern, responsive HTML-based applications.</li>
			<li> If you see something in your browser, JavaScript can “get at it” and put it under program-matic control. You can use the getElementById() method to access display elements.</li>
			<li>  An “event” is a crucial concept in interactive programming. Much JavaScript programming has to do with responses when something happens. The onLoad event is commonly used and triggers when its owner is complete.</li>
			<li>  You can show and hide elements using the HTML display attribute to make your displays “intelligent,” showing the end user pertinent information and hiding it when it’s no lon-ger needed.</li>
			<li>  You can use the createElement command and the appendChild method in JavaScript to add elements after the HTML is complete. </li>
