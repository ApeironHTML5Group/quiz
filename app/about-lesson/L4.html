		<h2>SKILL SUMMARY</h2>
		<h3>IN THIS LESSON YOU LEARNED:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> CSS is a crucial tool for achievement of much of the appearance and even behavior of modern mobile applications as well as Web sites. To build the “front end” of an app or Web site, and especially to keep its appearance correct and fresh as functional changes are made to the app or Web site during its lifetime, you need to understand CSS well and how CSS co-operates with other tools including HTML and JavaScript. You’ll also be in a far better position to estimate the effort required for particular projects when you fully digest concepts of user interface “style” as CSS uses them.</li>
			<li>You can create CSS files entirely from a simple text editor like Notepad. However, many HTML editors and application development tools provide a debugging feature that helps you quickly find errors in your markup and code. These tools also usually include a button to open a Web browser rather than having to do so manually. </li>
			<li>The <link> element links an HTML file to a CSS file. </li>
			<li>In HTML documents, it’s standard practice to maintain HTML files, which contain content, and simply reference a separate CSS file, which contains code for styling the content in the HTML files. This enables you to change styles in only one file (the CSS file), and see those style changes made throughout all associated HTML files automatically.</li>
			<li> When working on a small, standalone HTML file in which the styles probably won’t change, it’s acceptable to include CSS styling code within the HTML file itself.</li>
			<li> A CSS file typically contains a sequence of style specifications or rules and might include an initial @import rule.</li>
			<li> Typography has to do with the appearance of letters, numbers, and other characters.</li>
			<li>You can manage the flow of content in an HTML document using inline flow and block flow properties in CSS.</li>
			<li> HTML and CSS support a number of ways to specify where individual HTML elements appear within a display. The two most important for our purpose are float positioning and absolute positioning. </li>
			<li>  The HTML bounding box is a rectangle that includes all the letters of a block of text along with its background. CSS styling is expressed in terms of this box. The bounding box is not visible on Web pages by default.</li>
