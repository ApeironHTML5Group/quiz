		<h2>SKILL SUMMARY</h2>
		<h3>IN THIS LESSON YOU LEARNED:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Content flow has, historically, been a manual procedure in HTML documents. Today, CSS Regions, CSS Exclusions, and multi-column layouts help you flow content dynamically.</li>
			<li>  CSS Regions lets you flow content between neighboring or distant areas in an HTML document.</li>
			<li>  To create and work with CSS Regions, you need to identify a content source and create content containers. You accomplish both tasks using the flow-into and flow-from CSS properties.</li>
			<li>  CSS3 enables you to create multiple columns—newspaper style—in HTML documents that scale based on the user’s screen size.</li>
			<li> Hyphenation breaks words between syllables at the end of lines to create a more uniform right margin and eliminate gaps of whitespace within paragraphs. </li>
			<li>  A positioned float is a CSS construct that enables you to position images, text, and boxes anywhere in an HTML document and then wrap text completely around these elements. Positioned floats are called CSS Exclusions in the latest W3C specification.</li>
