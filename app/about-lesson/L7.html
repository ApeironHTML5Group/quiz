		<h2>SKILL SUMMARY</h2>
		<h3>IN THIS LESSON YOU LEARNED:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Some of the new graphics effects you can easily achieve with CSS3 are rounded corners, drop shadows, transparency, and background gradients.</li>
			<li> he border-radius property creates rounded corners, the box-shadow property creates drop shadows, the opacity property creates transparency effects, and the background property with one of the four gradient attributes creates linear and radial gradients.</li>
			<li> The Web Open Font Format (WOFF) is a means of bringing better typography to the Web. WOFF allows Web developers to use nearly any font instead of being limited to the  standard Web fonts.</li>
			<li> WOFF files are compressed True Type, OpenType, or Open Font Format fonts that contain additional metadata. </li>
			<li> The CSS3 transform property translates, scales, rotates, skews, and even spins 2D and 3D elements.</li>
			<li> Perspective, in terms of drawings and illustrations, is the convergence of lines that give the illusion of depth </li>
			<li> A transition is a change from one thing to another; in CSS, a transition is the change in an element from one style to another. </li>
			<li> An animation is the display of a sequence of static images at a fast enough speed to  create the illusion of movement. </li>
			<li> An SVG filter is a set of operations that use CSS to style or otherwise modify an SVG graphic. The enhanced graphic is displayed in a browser while the original graphic is left alone.</li>
			<li> Although the canvas element accepts only two attributes—height and width—you can use most CSS properties to style the canvas element, adding color, gradients, pattern fills, transformation, animation, and much more.</li>
