		<h2>SKILL SUMMARY</h2>
		<h3>IN THIS LESSON YOU LEARNED:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> A touch-enabled device interprets finger movements on a touch screen, called gestures, and converts them to instructions for an application. Many gestures have mouse  equivalents.</li>
			<li> The primary touch events are touchstart, touchmove, touchend, and touch-cancel. The primary gesture events are gesturestart, gesturechange, and gestureend.</li>
			<li> The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) maintains a living HTML specification that includes APIs that were not originally part of the HTML5 specifica-tion. These include Geolocation, Web Workers, WebSockets, and File API.</li>
			<li> The Geolocation API gets a user’s geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). The API can also show a map with a marker showing the user’s location based on the coordinates.</li>
			<li> Web Workers are scripts that run in the background, performing calculations or other actions that allow for a more responsive user interface.</li>
			<li> The WebSocket API enables you to open a persistent connection between a client and a Web server, and exchange text and binary files. WebSockets reduce the amount of over-head required for real-time communications.</li>
			<li> You can use the File API to upload individual or multiple files from a local disk or a device’s local storage to a remote server. You can also display uploaded image files in a Web  application.</li>
			<li> The Windows Runtime environment enables developers to access in-memory resources as well as hardware using APIs.</li>
			<li> HTML5 Web storage includes local storage (for persistent data) and session storage (for temporary data). </li>
			<li> Platform-independent applications run on a variety of desktop and mobile operating systems, and device-independent applications are device agnostic. You use JavaScript to access the Windows Runtime APIs for hardware devices.</li>
