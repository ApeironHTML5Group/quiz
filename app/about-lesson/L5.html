		<h2>SKILL SUMMARY</h2>
		<h3>IN THIS LESSON YOU LEARNED:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>  User interfaces can be clean and simple or more complex with several sections, buttons, and controls.</li>
			<li> Designing an interface that renders well on large PC screens and small mobile devices used to require a lot of markup and code. Today, the CSS Flexbox Box and Grid Layout models reduce the amount of code required for cross-device compatibility. Because the CSS specifications are not yet final, you’ll need to use vendor prefixes before CSS property names to make everything work.</li>
			<li>Flexboxes are designed for toolbars, menus, forms, and similar elements in Web pages and applications. Grids are better suited to more complex designs.</li>
			<li> Both a flexbox and its contents can be configured to change size, horizontally and verti-cally, when the screen on which they’re displayed changes size. You can also reverse the direction and order of flexboxes with one line of code.</li>
			<li>A flexbox can include child boxes that are flexible by height and width. You use the flex property to work with child boxes. The flex-flow property sets the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties of a flexbox (the parent box) at the same time.</li>
			<li> Grid layouts are similar to spreadsheets in that they use columns, rows, and cells, but you can create many different types of layouts that, in the end, don’t look like a spreadsheet at all.</li>
			<li> You use the CSS properties display:grid (or display:inline-grid), grid-columns, and grid-rows to create grid structures. The size of columns and rows can be fixed or flexible.•  Flexboxes and grids are designed to scale proportionally.</li>
			<li>The flex-order property enables you to change the order of child items in a flexbox, rear-ranging them in any order you like without having to change them in the HTML markup. </li>
			<li> A grid template uses alphabetical characters to represent the position of items in a grid. You use the alpha characters with the grid-template, grid-rows, and grid-columns properties to create a grid into which data flows.</li>
